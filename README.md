# Bellabeat Wellness Data Analysis with R
Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.


### Step 01: ASK
We want to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. We will select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation.

Question of the client:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

**Stakeholders**
Urška Sršen - Bellabeat cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
Sando Mur - Bellabeat cofounder and key member of Bellabeat executive team

#### Deliverables:
1. A clear summary of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis

**Business Task:** The main task is to identify the usage trends of other smart devices and find a way to implement those in our devices.

**Data Source:** This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.


   
### Step 02: PREPARE

The data has been downloaded from Kaggle and stored in a new and separate folder so that it is easily accessible.

**Data Organization and verification:**

Available to us are 18 CSV documents. Each document represents different quantitative data tracked by Fitbit. The data is considered long since each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.Every user has a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and time.

Due to the small size of sample I sorted and filtered tables creating Pivot Tables in Excel. I was able to verify attributes and observations of each table and relations between tables. Counted sample size (users) of each table and verified time length of analysis - 31 days.

| Table Name                  | Type                   | Description                                                                                             |

**Data Credibility and Integrity:**

Due to the limitation of size (30 users) and not having any demographic information we could encounter a sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the population as a whole. Another problem we would encounter is that the dataset is not current and also the time limitation of the survey (2 months long). That is why we will give our case study an operational approach.


### Step 03: PROCESS

I will focus my analysis in R due to the accessibility, amount of data and to be able to create data visualization to share my results with stakeholders.

We will choose the packages that will help us on our analysis and open them. We will use the following packages for our analysis:

1. tidyverse
2. here
3. skimr
4. janitor
5. lubridate
6. ggpubr
7. ggrepel

**Code**

```
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(ggrepel)
```


**Importing datasets**

Knowing the datasets we have, we will upload the datasets that will help us answer our business task. On our analysis we will focus on the following datasets:

Daily_activity
Daily_sleep
Hourly_steps
Due to the the small sample we won't consider for this analysis Weight (8 Users) and heart rate (7 users)

**Code**

```
daily_activity <- read_csv(file = "D:/Desktop/Data Analysis/Data Sets and Analysis/Capstone Project/bellabeta/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read_csv(file = "D:/Desktop/Data Analysis/Data Sets and Analysis/Capstone Project/bellabeta/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv(file = "D:/Desktop/Data Analysis/Data Sets and Analysis/Capstone Project/bellabeta/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
```


We will preview our selected data frames and check the summary of each column.
```
head(daily_activity)
str(daily_activity)

head(daily_sleep)
str(daily_sleep)

head(hourly_steps)
str(hourly_steps)
```


**Cleaning and formatting**

Now that we got to know more about our data structures we will process them to look for any errors and inconsistencies.

Before we continue with our cleaning we want to make sure how many unique users are per data frame. Even though 30 is the minimal sample size we will still keep the sleep dataset for practice only.

```
n_unique(daily_activity$Id)
n_unique(daily_sleep$Id)
n_unique(hourly_steps$Id)
```

**Duplicates**

We will now look for any duplicates:

```
sum(duplicated(daily_activity))
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
sum(duplicated(hourly_steps))
```


**Remove duplicates and N/A**

Knowing the length of our observations (daily_sleep 413) we are able to delete duplicates for daily_sleep.

```
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()

daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()

hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na()
```

We will verify that duplicates have been removed

```
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
```

**Clean and rename columns**

We want to ensure that column names are using right syntax and same format in all datasets since we will merge them later on. We are changing the format of all columns to lower case.

```
clean_names(daily_activity)
daily_activity<- rename_with(daily_activity, tolower)
clean_names(daily_sleep)
daily_sleep <- rename_with(daily_sleep, tolower)
clean_names(hourly_steps)
hourly_steps <- rename_with(hourly_steps, tolower)
```

**Consistency of date and time columns**

Now that we have verified our column names and change them to lower case, we will focus on cleaning date-time format for daily_activity and daily_sleep since we will merge both data frames. Since we can disregard the time on daily_sleep data frame we are using as_date instead as as_datetime

```
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  rename(date = activitydate) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))

daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  rename(date = sleepday) %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(date,format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))
```

We will check our cleaned datasets

```
head(daily_activity)
head(daily_sleep)
```
